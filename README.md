# Hi There!
I’m <i>Ezra</i>.
I like building software and figuring out how things work. A lot of what I do involves backend and distributed systems, along with real-time applications, mostly because I enjoy working close to how systems behave under real constraints.

I’m still learning and experimenting, breaking things and fixing them again. Lately, I’ve been paying more attention to how small design choices affect performance, complexity, and how painful future changes might be.

Most repositories here are experiments, learning projects, or small tools I build while exploring these ideas.

**Core technologies I work with:**
